# Sublime-installer

This bash script installs the latest Sublime Text (4) version.

This script contains shell commands from Sublime Text [official web site](https://www.sublimetext.com/), from [here](https://www.sublimetext.com/docs/linux_repositories.html).

And it installs the **Stable** Build (Not Dev build)

This script supports **most of** Linux distributions (except some niche ones like Gentoo).

# Note
***After some time commands to install Sublime Text are changed by the Devs, so at some point my script will become outdated.*** 

***I don't often monitor the commands***
